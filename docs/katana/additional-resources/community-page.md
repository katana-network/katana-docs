## Join the Katana Developer Community

Katana’s edge comes from the energy and collaboration of its community. Whether you're a developer, founder, creator, or just curious about the project, we want you involved.

### Explore the Katana Developer Ecosystem

We’ve curated a [comprehensive Awesome List](https://github.com/katana-network/awesome-katana) that includes resources, tools, and projects built on Katana. This is the best place to dive deeper into everything Katana has to offer, from tech stacks to community-driven initiatives.

### Connect With Us on Telegram

For real-time updates, discussions, and to interact with other members of the Katana community, join our official Telegram group. Connect with fellow members, get early access to new developments, swap yield alpha, and contribute to the future of DeFi. To join, [apply for early developer access](http://google.com/).

### Get Involved

We want your input. Whether it’s new ideas, contributing to docs, flagging an issue, or simply sharing a new tip, your contribution makes Katana — and DeFi — better for everyone.

The Katana developer community would love to see:

- Experiments with the starter kit
- PRs to the docs, examples, awesome list, and other tools
- Primitives and new money legos
