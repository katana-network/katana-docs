# Grants and Other Support Programs

Katana does not run an official grant program. Instead, the team evaluates
opportunities to support on a case‑by‑case basis, depending on what you are
building and how well it aligns with Katana’s core infrastructure, primitives,
and applications.

## What we can help with

- Technical guidance on architecture, integrations, and best practices
- Intros to relevant infra partners and ecosystem teams
- Feedback on product scope, milestones, and roadmap
- Co‑marketing for meaningful launches and integrations (subject to readiness)

Funding is not guaranteed and is generally uncommon. When it happens, it is
evaluated case‑by‑case and typically tied to clear milestones and ecosystem
impact.

## How we evaluate requests

- Strategic alignment with Katana’s core infra and primitives
- Depth of integration and network effects (composability with existing protocols)
- Product differentiation and quality of execution
- Team strength and history of shipping
- Security posture (threat model, audits/peer review, testing)
- Realistic go‑to‑market, user acquisition, and sustainability plan

Projects that are unique, technically sound, and well‑integrated with existing
primitives generally receive more attention.

## How to request support

Hit us up in the [Katana Devs Telegram chat](https://t.me/katanadevs), where you
will be given feedback and further instructions.

## What to build

You can find some ideas on [this page](https://superdocs.katana.tools/what-to-build).

## Not a fit

The following are generally not eligible for support:

- Copy‑paste forks with minimal differentiation
- Short‑term, purely speculative token plays with no product roadmap
- Requests lacking a clear problem statement, plan, or milestones
- Competition to our core apps / primitivies. We prioritize deep, concentrated
  liquidity and wish to avoid fragmenting the ecosystem. As such, projects that
  build on top of what already exists are prioritized.

## Disclaimer

Support decisions are discretionary and may change as the ecosystem evolves.
Submitting a request does not guarantee any form of support.
