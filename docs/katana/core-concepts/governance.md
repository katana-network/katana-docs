# **Katana Governance**
## **Overview: Decentralized from First Principles**

Katana is decentralized by design. 

From day one, Katana launches with Stage 1 decentralization, the leading operational standard for L2 networks.

It meets and exceeds this standard via…

* Full Execution Proofs, which use zero-knowledge technology to ensure that chain data is accurate; 

Instead, **on-chain controls and institutional checks** ensure that governance decisions reflect the interests of a diverse, security-conscious ecosystem. All critical upgrades and administrative functions must be reviewed and approved by a group of independent stakeholders, rather than a single team or company.

### **What Is Stage 1 Decentralization?**

According to frameworks from Ethereum researchers and communities like L2Beat, a network achieves **stage 1 decentralization** when:

* Core infrastructure is controlled by a smart contract-based timelock

* Critical actions can be delayed, reviewed, and blocked by independent actors

* Emergency powers are held by a decentralized group of ecosystem stakeholders

Katana meets all these requirements at launch. Control over key contracts, upgrades, token issuance, and fee systems is exercised **on-chain**, gated by a timelock contract and protected by the **Katana DeFi Security Council**.

## **Overview: Purpose-Built for Security, Speed, and Ecosystem-First Control**

**Katana** is more than a high-yield, deep-liquidity DeFi chain—it’s a governance-first blockchain where infrastructure and decision-making are embedded directly into the chain’s architecture. From day one, Katana’s technical governance ensures rapid iteration and swift emergency response—without compromising decentralization.

Katana launches with a two-tier governance structure: a nimble proposal engine (Katana Admin) and a robust safety mechanism (DeFi Security Council). Together, they ensure Katana Network can evolve quickly, protect user funds, and stay aligned with its ecosystem partners.

## **tl;dr: Two Multisigs, One Coordinated System**

* **Katana Admin (5/9 Multisig):** Proposes all critical system changes. Controlled by foundational engineering contributors at Katana Foundation, Polygon Labs, Conduit, and GSR.  
* **DeFi Security Council (10/13 Multisig):** Oversees system security. Can veto or fast-track changes. Composed of top-tier infrastructure providers and DeFi integrators offering in-protocol services and tooling within the Katana ecosystem. 

Security and speed shouldn’t be trade-offs. By separating proposal power (Admin) from execution control (Security Council), Katana ensures:

* **Fast iteration** without sacrificing trust.  
* **Robust defense** against bugs or exploits.  
* **Clear accountability** backed by top-tier ecosystem partners.

Just like Katana’s yield-generating tokens and composable apps, governance here is protocol-native—flexible enough to evolve, and secure enough to scale.

## **Katana Admin: Fast, Focused, and Frameworked**

*Multisig Address: TBD*

The **Katana Admin** multisig is the operational heartbeat of Katana governance. It initiates all technical upgrades, config changes, and system-level proposals. Here’s how it works:

* **5-of-9 multisig**, controlled by major network partners Katana Foundation, GSR, Conduit, and Polygon Labs.

* Upgrades and improvements are proposed by the Admin and automatically enter a **10-day timelock**—a cooling-off period designed to give the network time to audit and react.

* The Admin is responsible for **systems-level architecture**: bridge contracts, verifier upgrades, revenue mechanisms, $KAT token issuance, and ecosystem subsidies.

Think of the Admin as the first-mover in a system built for safe agility—ready to evolve Katana without risking centralization.

## **DeFi Security Council: Watchdog with Real Teeth**

*Multisig Address: TBD*

Sitting above the Admin multisig is the **DeFi Security Council**, a 13-member multisig that provides oversight and final control. It’s designed for **ecosystem-aligned emergency governance**, and it plays two critical roles:

1. **Veto Power:** With a 10-of-13 vote, the Council can stop any Admin proposal before it executes.

2. **Emergency Execution:** In the event of a critical vulnerability or exploit, the Council can skip the timelock entirely and push upgrades live immediately.

Members include leading DeFi protocols and infrastructure teams operating within Katana—those running core apps, managing stablecoins, or maintaining validator infrastructure.

## **Communication and Coordination**

The Council operates informally via secure channels like Telegram or Signal.

Proposals, upgrades, and emergency signals are shared asynchronously.

Polygon Labs manages onboarding and ops support for both Admin and Council multisigs.
