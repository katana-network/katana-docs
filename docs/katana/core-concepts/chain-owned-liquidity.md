Katana Network will own liquidity in the form of core assets, which are deployed across the core applications so that users get access to the best pricing and liquidity. The chain owned liquidity will be funded from the sequencer fees.

#### **Core Applications and Core Assets**

Katana Network's core applications promote composability and enshrine deep liquidity. These applications map to the primitives that are foundational to any DeFi ecosystem:

* Spot DEX: Sushi  
* Lending & Borrowing: Morpho  
* Perp DEX: Vertex

The network also comes with a set of yield-generating tokens, and asset types:

* Native Stablecoin: AUSD  
* Bridged Meta Assets: VaultBridge (i.e. vbTokens)  
* Asset Importer Protocol: Universal

The yield generated from these tokens provides one of the revenue streams used to boost the yield for active users of the core applications.
