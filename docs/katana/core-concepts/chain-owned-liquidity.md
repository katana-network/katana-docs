Katana will own liquidity in the form of core assets, which are deployed across the core applications so that users get access to the best pricing and liquidity. The chain owned liquidity will be funded from the sequencer fees.

#### **Core Applications and Core Assets**

Katana's core applications promote composability and enshrine deep liquidity. These applications map to the primitives that are foundational to any DeFi ecosystem:

- Spot DEX: Sushi
- Lending & Borrowing: Morpho
- Perp DEX: Vertex

Katana also comes with a set of yield-generating tokens, and asset types:

- Native Stablecoin: AUSD
- Bridged Meta Assets: Vault Bridge (i.e. vbTokens)
- Asset Importer Protocol: Universal
- Native Bitcoin Wrapper: Lombard (LBTC)

The yield generated from these tokens provides one of the revenue streams used to boost the yield for active users of the core applications.
