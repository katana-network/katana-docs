# Katana Documentation

   - **Well documented**: Use clear commit messages. Explain your changes in the pull request description.
   - **Tested**: Verify your changes do not break existing functionality.
   - **Styled correctly**: Follow the [Microsoft Style Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/welcome/).

### Creating a pull request

1. **Pull request**: Once your changes are complete, create a pull request against the main branch of the Agglayer Documentation.
